## Questions: Frontend File Setup

Answer the following questions with your group:

- How do you link a JavaScript file to an HTML document?
- How do you link a CSS file to an HTML document?
- What are the roles of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript on a webpage?
- What is the DOM? How is it related to HTML, CSS, and JavaScript?

## Exercise: Basic Frontend File Setup

Create the basic frontend file setup in a new folder. You should have:

- an html file `index.html` with a header and a paragraph
- a css file `style.css` with a single rule changing something about the display of the elements
- a js file `index.js` with a single statement logging "Hello, world" to the console
- tags linking the css and the javascript into your html file

Open the index.html file and verify that the CSS and JS are linked to your files and running.

## Group Exploration: Chrome DevTools

Chrome's Developer Tools are powerful tools for inspecting and debugging frontend applications. With your group, explore the DevTools for your new frontend project and answer the following questions:

- How do you open the Developer Tools?
- How do you log different values from your JavaScript program to the Console tab? How do you log multiple values at once?
- How do you use JavaScript's `debugger` keyword?
- How do you highlight an element in the DOM from the Elements tab?
- How do you find the DOM representation of an element that's displayed on the page? (Hint: Check the mouse-in-square button in the top navigation bar of the DevTools)
- How do you change the content that appears on the page using the Elements tab?
- What do each of the Elements, Console, Sources, and Network tabs show you?
